As an alternative to SSH, you can use HTTPS with Git, see [Smart HTTP Support blog post] (http://github.com/blog/642-smart-http-support).

Assuming you already have msysgit installed, here is how to set-up things up on Windows so that git doesn't keep asking for you password:

In Windows Explorer, right-click anywhere and open a Git Bash command prompt, and type:

<pre class="terminal">$ cd ~
$ touch ~/_netrc
$ chmod 600 ~/_netrc
</pre>

Edit e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\-YOU-\_netrc with your favourite text editor to add:

<pre>
machine github.com
login -YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME-
password -YOUR-GITHUB-PASSWORD-NAME-
</pre>

but *make sure that you use _UNIX Text_ line endings (LF only), and that you _DO NOT HAVE a trailing carriage return after the password_, i.e. the last byte of _netrc must be the last character of your password*.


When you clone repos from github, you now *must remove the username* from the HTTPS URL; e.g. instead of https://vorburger@github.com/vorburger/help.github.com.git use:

@git clone https://github.com/vorburger/help.github.com.git

Note that you must do a fresh clone, re-using a previously cloned local repo which has the username in the URL will not work.

Now test your configuration set-up by doing an (empty) push:

@git push

If all went well, this will not have asked you for your GitHub password anymore.
